# AI in action: From ML models to games

## Meetup description
Let's dive together into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence in game development and gamification. 

### Talk 1 - Generating natural landscapes for Go Wayback with pysheds and ML by Joey Faulkner, a Senior Machine Learning Research Engineer at PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions.

In this talk we will take a deep dive into how we setup and train our guided generation system for our upcoming game Prologue: Go Wayback!. Our guided generation system allows creative people to design rough outlines of levels which then create landscapes which retain natural features. This allows us to generate near-infinite varied landscapes but still include creativity from level designers (and even players!).  We will go over data preparation with pysheds, training with huggingface diffusers and shipping to users with ONNX.

### Talk 2 - How to create 'sentient' but coherent NPC with AI by Alisa Dammer, a freelancer SWE, MLE, MLOps, AI

Main focus of the talk will be on ensuring coherent behavior of the NPC using (pretty much any) LLM. Technology agnostic, this talk presents general problematic and a simple solution.

### Talk 3 - Playing Fair?: GenAI, Game Design, and Inclusion by Si√¢n Brooke, an Assistant Professor and MacGillavry Fellow at the DLab, Informatics Institute, University of Amsterdam. 

As generative AI (GenAI) becomes increasingly embedded in the game development pipeline, from character creation to procedural world-building, it brings with it both exciting possibilities and ethical challenges. This talk explores how GenAI tools are shaping the future of games, and asks: Who might be left out of what we are designing? Focusing on issues of gender, queer, neurodiversity and intersectional inclusion, this talk will examine how bias can enter at every stage of the development process and how these biases can impact both players and creators.
