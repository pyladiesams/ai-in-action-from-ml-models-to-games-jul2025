# AI in action: From ML models to games

## Meetup description
Let's dive together into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence in game development and gamification. 

### Talk 1 - Generating natural landscapes for Go Wayback with pysheds and ML by Joey Faulkner, a Senior Machine Learning Research Engineer at PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions.

In this talk we will take a deep dive into how we setup and train our guided generation system for our upcoming game Prologue: Go Wayback!. Our guided generation system allows creative people to design rough outlines of levels which then create landscapes which retain natural features. This allows us to generate near-infinite varied landscapes but still include creativity from level designers (and even players!).  We will go over data preparation with pysheds, training with huggingface diffusers and shipping to users with ONNX.
